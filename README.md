# Proposal

I'm proposing to Laura on July 4th, 2024, and as a builder at heart, I'm doing it the only way I know how: programmatically.

Her favorite game growing up was the Nancy Drew series, so we'll be recreating an experience inspired by it. 

Flow of the game:

1) Initial screen with a password that she will have to find 
2) Screens with 3 nav buttons where the background image will be areas in our house to navigate and find other clues
